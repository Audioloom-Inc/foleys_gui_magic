Contributing to foleys_plugin_magic
===================================

This is an open source project, aimed to collaborate with anyone interested in learning from the code,
using the code or improving it through criticism, suggestions and much appreciated code submissions
via pull requests.

The coding style is aligned with JUCE's coding standards: https://juce.com/discover/stories/coding-standards

All work is done voluntarily for the pleasure and benefit for all users. Features are added, when they are ready,
and integrated, if they fit our goals.
We will at our discretion integrate or rewrite pull requests, but often we will ask to adapt things to fit our needs.

The repository https://github.com/ffAudio/PluginGuiMagic is the reference. All pull requests should check,
that none of the example projects break.

We are looking forward to a fruitful collaboration!
