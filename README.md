foleys_gui_magic
===============

This module allows to create GUIs without any coding. It is created with a DOM model
that provides a hierarchical information, and a CSS cascading stylesheet to define
rules for the appeareance of the GUI.

There will be a drag and drop editor to add GUI elements, and to connect to
parameters of your AudioProcessorValueTreeState. Also an editor in the style of FireBug
to investigate the individual properties, and how they were obtained/calculated.
